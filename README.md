# NYSRIDOITT

As per the requirement, I have created a Resource group, Virtual network, Cosmos DB and Azure linux VM. 
You will find all of them in this Repository. Also, i have the azure services running in my account.
In order to create a pipeline, i will have to run all of these services sequentially and they will be created accordingly.
